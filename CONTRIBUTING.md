## Awesome Azure

### A Note on Awesome Azure

Each repo listed meets at least one of the following requirements:

* Community-authored repo with 100+ stars
* Community-vouched repo with < 100 stars
* Official repo from [Azure](https://github.com/Azure) or [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft)

100+ stars for community repos is not a strict requirement, it only serves as a guideline for the initial compilation.  If you can vouch for the awesomeness of a repo with < 100 stars and you can explain why it should be listed, please submit a pull request.

Pull requests might be left open for a period of time to let the community chime in and vouch for it.  An official repo from [Azure](https://github.com/Azure) or [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) can be removed if the community wishes.  Check out the [awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md).

### Pull Requests

* Add one link per pull request.
* Add the link:
    * `[name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
    * Keep descriptions concise.
    * Maintain alphabetical ordering where applicable.
* Add a section if needed.

* Send a pull request with the reason why the addition is awesome.

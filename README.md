## Community Calls

Our _Community Calls_ cover a broad range of topics on the Azure cloud,
developer tooling and industry trends. If you have topics of interest or want to
help us come up with the most relevant topics please feel free to upvote,
comment or create new topics for upcoming community calls [on our discussions
page](https://github.com/Azure/dev-community/discussions/categories/community-call-topic-suggestions).
We will source future topics from the highest voted suggestions.

Once we've selected a topic for an upcoming community call we will create a new
GitHub Issue from that topic and have the presenters assigned to that issue. We
will upload the recording of the call and close the issue once it's available.
